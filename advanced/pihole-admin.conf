    # X-Pi-hole is a response header for debugging using curl -I
    # X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking attacks and helps ensure your content is not embedded into other sites via < frame >, < iframe > or < object >.
    # X-XSS-Protection sets the configuration for the cross-site scripting filters built into most browsers. This is important because it tells the browser to block the response if a malicious script has been inserted from a user input. (deprecated; disabled)
    # X-Content-Type-Options stops a browser from trying to MIME-sniff the content type and forces it to stick with the declared content-type. This is important because the browser will only load external resources if their content-type matches what is expected, and not malicious hidden code.
    # Content-Security-Policy tells the browser where resources are allowed to be loaded and if it’s allowed to parse/run inline styles or Javascript. This is important because it prevents content injection attacks, such as Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
    # X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies is an XML document that grants a web client, such as Adobe Flash Player or Adobe Acrobat (though not necessarily limited to these), permission to handle data across domains.
    # Referrer-Policy allows control/restriction of the amount of information present in the referral header for links away from your page—the URL path or even if the header is sent at all.
